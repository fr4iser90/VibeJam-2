# Gesture Recognition Engine – Phase 1: Mouse Path Analysis

## Overview
Implementation of mouse path tracking and analysis algorithms for gesture recognition. This phase focuses on capturing user input, smoothing paths, and preparing data for pattern recognition.

## Objectives
- [x] Implement mouse path tracking
- [x] Create path smoothing algorithms
- [x] Add path normalization
- [x] Implement path segmentation
- [x] Create path visualization

## Deliverables
- File: `js/gesture-recognition.js` - Main gesture recognition class with path tracking
- Feature: Mouse and touch event handling - Real-time path capture
- Feature: Path smoothing and normalization - Mathematical processing
- Feature: Canvas visualization - Visual feedback for users
- Integration: Fantasy OS main system - Component initialization

## Dependencies
- Requires: Fantasy OS Foundation (completed)
- Blocks: Phase 2 start

## Estimated Time
0.75 hours

## Success Criteria
- [x] Mouse path tracking works correctly
- [x] Touch events supported for mobile
- [x] Path smoothing algorithms implemented
- [x] Canvas visualization functional
- [x] Integration with Fantasy OS complete

## Implementation Status
**COMPLETED** - All objectives have been implemented in the current codebase:

### Mouse Path Tracking ✅
- Mouse events: `mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`, `mouseout`
- Touch events: `touchstart`, `touchmove`, `touchend`
- Path storage with timestamps and coordinates
- Real-time drawing on canvas

### Path Smoothing & Normalization ✅
- Bounding box calculation
- Aspect ratio computation
- Curvature analysis
- Direction change counting
- Path closure detection

### Canvas Visualization ✅
- Golden stroke color (`#D4AF37`)
- Smooth line drawing with `lineCap: 'round'`
- Automatic canvas clearing after gesture
- Visual feedback for user input

### Integration ✅
- Properly integrated into Fantasy OS main system
- Component initialization in `main.js`
- Canvas element in HTML structure
- Event handling setup

## Code Quality Assessment
- **Architecture**: Clean class-based design
- **Error Handling**: Proper null checks and validation
- **Performance**: Efficient path processing
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- **Standards**: Follows project coding conventions

## Notes
The implementation exceeds the original requirements by including:
- Touch support for mobile devices
- Comprehensive mathematical analysis
- Visual feedback system
- Integration with spell casting system
- Recognition history tracking
