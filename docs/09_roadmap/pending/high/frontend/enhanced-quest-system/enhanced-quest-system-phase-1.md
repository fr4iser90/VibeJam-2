# Quest System â€“ Phase 1: Quest Manager Foundation

## Overview
Create the core quest management system with state management, progress tracking, and basic quest mechanics. This phase establishes the foundation for all quest functionality.

## Objectives
- [ ] Create QuestManager class with state management
- [ ] Implement quest progress tracking system
- [ ] Add quest dependency system
- [ ] Create quest reward system
- [ ] Add quest validation and completion logic
- [ ] Integrate with existing FantasyOS core system
- [ ] Add LocalStorage persistence for quest state

## Deliverables
- File: `js/quest-manager.js` - Main quest management system
- File: `js/quest-content.js` - Quest storylines and content definitions
- File: `css/quest-ui.css` - Quest-specific UI styling
- Integration: Update `js/main.js` to include quest manager
- Integration: Update `index.html` to include quest UI components
- Test: `frontend/tests/unit/QuestManager.test.js` - Unit tests for quest system

## Dependencies
- Requires: Existing FantasyOS core system
- Requires: Room Manager system for room-specific quests
- Requires: Object Interaction system for quest triggers
- Blocks: Phase 2 (Multi-Act Storyline System)
- Blocks: Phase 3 (Room-Specific Quest Integration)

## Estimated Time
8 hours

## Success Criteria
- [ ] QuestManager class created and functional
- [ ] Quest state persistence working with LocalStorage
- [ ] Quest progress tracking system operational
- [ ] Quest dependency system implemented
- [ ] Quest reward system functional
- [ ] Integration with FantasyOS core complete
- [ ] Unit tests passing with 85% coverage
- [ ] Quest UI components responsive and accessible

## Technical Implementation Details

### QuestManager Class Structure
```javascript
class QuestManager {
    constructor() {
        this.activeQuests = new Map();
        this.completedQuests = new Set();
        this.questProgress = new Map();
        this.questRewards = new Map();
        this.questDependencies = new Map();
        this.hobbitPersonality = new HobbitPersonality();
    }
    
    // Core methods to implement
    startQuest(questId)
    updateQuestProgress(questId, step)
    completeQuest(questId)
    checkQuestDependencies(questId)
    awardQuestReward(questId)
    saveQuestState()
    loadQuestState()
}
```

### Quest Content Structure
```javascript
const questContent = {
    'credentials-recovery': {
        id: 'credentials-recovery',
        title: 'The Hobbit\'s Lost Legacy - Act 1',
        description: 'Help the Hobbit recover his Fantasy OS credentials',
        steps: [...],
        rewards: [...],
        dependencies: []
    }
};
```

### Integration Points
- FantasyOS core system initialization
- Room Manager for room-specific quest triggers
- Object Interaction for quest action triggers
- Sound System for quest completion sounds
- Particle System for quest reward effects

## Risk Mitigation
- **State Persistence Issues**: Implement robust error handling and validation
- **Performance Impact**: Use efficient data structures and lazy loading
- **Integration Complexity**: Follow established FantasyOS patterns
- **Quest Content Complexity**: Start with simple quest structure, expand later

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all QuestManager methods
- Integration tests with FantasyOS core
- State persistence validation tests
- Quest dependency validation tests
- Performance tests for large quest datasets
