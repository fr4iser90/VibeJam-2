## Technical Implementation Details

### Main Questline Structure
```javascript
const mainQuestline = {
    'hobbit-legacy': {
        title: 'The Hobbit\'s Lost Legacy',
        acts: {
            'act-1': {
                title: 'Credential Recovery',
                description: 'Help the Hobbit recover his Fantasy OS credentials',
                steps: [...],
                rewards: ['unlock-kitchen', 'magic-level-10']
            },
            'act-2': {
                title: 'Ancient Artifacts Discovery',
                description: 'Discover ancient magical artifacts hidden in the rooms',
                steps: [...],
                rewards: ['unlock-workshop', 'spell-unlock-fireball']
            },
            'act-3': {
                title: 'Magic System Restoration',
                description: 'Restore the corrupted magic system',
                steps: [...],
                rewards: ['unlock-library', 'gesture-unlock-spiral']
            },
            'act-4': {
                title: 'Portal Network Activation',
                description: 'Activate the portal network between rooms',
                steps: [...],
                rewards: ['unlock-bedroom', 'portal-mastery']
            },
            'act-5': {
                title: 'Fantasy OS Mastery',
                description: 'Master the complete Fantasy OS system',
                steps: [...],
                rewards: ['unlock-garden', 'fantasy-os-master']
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### Achievement System Structure
```javascript
class AchievementSystem {
    constructor() {
        this.achievements = new Map();
        this.completedAchievements = new Set();
        this.achievementRewards = new Map();
    }
    
    // Methods to implement
    checkAchievementProgress(achievementId)
    awardAchievement(achievementId)
    displayAchievementNotification(achievementId)
    getAchievementProgress(achievementId)
}
```

### Quest Progression UI Components
- Act completion indicators
- Quest step progress bars
- Achievement notifications
- Quest choice dialogs
- Storyline progression timeline

## Risk Mitigation
- **Content Complexity**: Break down each act into manageable steps
- **UI Complexity**: Use component-based approach with clear separation
- **Performance**: Implement lazy loading for quest content
- **Storyline Coherence**: Maintain consistent narrative flow

## Testing Strategy
- Integration tests for complete questline flow
- Achievement system validation tests
- Quest choice branching tests
- UI component interaction tests
- Performance tests for large quest datasets
