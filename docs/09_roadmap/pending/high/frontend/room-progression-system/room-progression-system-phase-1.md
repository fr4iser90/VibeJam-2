# Room Progression System â€“ Phase 1: Room Unlocking System

## Overview
Implement the foundation of the room progression system by creating room unlocking mechanics, progressive access control, and quest-based room unlocking. This phase establishes the core progression state management and room dependency system.

## Objectives
- [ ] Create RoomProgression class with state management
- [ ] Implement progressive room access control
- [ ] Add quest-based room unlocking
- [ ] Create room dependency system
- [ ] Implement room mastery tracking

## Deliverables
- File: `js/room-progression.js` - Main room progression system with state management
- File: `js/room-unlocking.js` - Room unlocking mechanics and access control
- Integration: Room progression system integration with existing room manager
- UI: Room progression indicators in navigation tabs
- Storage: LocalStorage integration for progression state persistence

## Dependencies
- Requires: Enhanced Quest System (for quest-based unlocking)
- Blocks: Phase 2 (Secret Passages System) start
- Integrates with: Existing RoomManager, QuestManager, AchievementSystem

## Estimated Time
6 hours

## Implementation Details

### Core Components
1. **RoomProgression Class**
   - State management for room access levels
   - Progression tracking and persistence
   - Integration with quest system
   - Room dependency validation

2. **Room Unlocking System**
   - Quest-based room unlocking
   - Achievement-based room access
   - Progressive room mastery levels
   - Room access validation

3. **Room Dependency System**
   - Room prerequisite tracking
   - Unlocking sequence management
   - Dependency validation logic

### Integration Points
- **RoomManager**: Add progression checks to room switching
- **QuestManager**: Listen for quest completion events
- **AchievementSystem**: Track room exploration achievements
- **UI**: Update room tabs with progression indicators

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All objectives completed
- [ ] Room progression system functional
- [ ] Quest-based room unlocking working
- [ ] Room dependency system operational
- [ ] Integration with existing systems complete
- [ ] Tests passing for core functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Technical Requirements
- **State Management**: LocalStorage for progression persistence
- **Event System**: Integration with existing Fantasy OS event handlers
- **UI Updates**: Room tab progression indicators
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for missing progression data
- **Performance**: <40ms response time for progression updates

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: RoomProgression class methods
- **Integration Tests**: Quest system integration
- **UI Tests**: Room tab progression indicators
- **E2E Tests**: Complete room unlocking flow
