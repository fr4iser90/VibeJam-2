## 📊 Task Splitting Assessment

### Size Analysis
- **Total Time**: 16 hours
- **File Count**: 5 files to create/modify
- **Phase Count**: 3 phases
- **Complexity**: Medium complexity

### Splitting Criteria Evaluation
- **Time Threshold**: 16 hours > 8 hours ❌ (exceeds threshold)
- **File Count**: 5 files < 10 files ✅ (within limit)
- **Phase Count**: 3 phases < 5 phases ✅ (within limit)
- **Complexity**: Medium complexity ✅ (manageable)

### Task Splitting Recommendation
**✅ NO SPLITTING REQUIRED**

**Reasoning**:
- While 16 hours exceeds the 8-hour threshold, the task is well-structured with clear phases
- File count (5) and phase count (3) are within acceptable limits
- The phases are logically independent and can be implemented sequentially
- The complexity is manageable for a single developer
- The existing codebase provides strong foundation for implementation

### Alternative Assessment
If splitting were required, it would be:
- **Subtask 1**: Room Unlocking System (6 hours) - Foundation
- **Subtask 2**: Secret Passages System (6 hours) - Exploration
- **Subtask 3**: Room Upgrade System (4 hours) - Enhancement
